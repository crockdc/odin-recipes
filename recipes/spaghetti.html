    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spaghetti with meat sauce is a classic dish that is easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. The sauce is rich and flavorful, made with ground meat, tomatoes, and herbs. Serve it over al dente spaghetti for a comforting meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) lean ground meat like ground beef or ground turkey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (130g) chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced, 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water, broth, or dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (28oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven).</li>
        <li>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. Stir and taste the sauce a few times to adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions, checking for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and let it absorb some of the sauce for a minute.</li>
        <li>Toss again and serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
