    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These brownies are rich, fudgy, and incredibly chocolatey. They are perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth. Serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons (145g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (250g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (80g) chopped walnuts, pecans, or chocolate chips, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325°F (162°C). Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool until warm, about 5 to 10 minutes. Test the temperature by touching the batter; it should be comfortable to hold without feeling hot.</li>
        <li>Add the cold eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition.</li>
        <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in nuts or chocolate chips if desired.</li>
        <li>Spread the thick brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan. It can be hard to spread because it is so thick. Do your best to push the batter to the corners and even out the top.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle is slightly underbaked, about 20 to 30 minutes. A toothpick plunged into the center should emerge somewhat moist with batter.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before removing the brownies from the pan. Cut into 16 squares. For clean edges, use a chef’s knife and wipe it clean after each slice.</li>
        <li>For guaranteed perfect edges, chill the brownies in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
